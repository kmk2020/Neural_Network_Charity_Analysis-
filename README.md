# Overview of the project

Bek’s come a long way since her first day at that boot camp five years ago—and since earlier this week, when she started learning about neural networks! Now, she is finally ready to put her skills to work to help the foundation predict where to make investments.

With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

## Deliverables

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Analysis README.md
